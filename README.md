## Customer Registration Exercise

This project is a customer registration application developed using Jakarta EE. The application was created as part of the fourth module of the Back-end track of the [Futuro Polo Tech](https://polotech.americanas.io/) program. This program is a partnership between the technology school [Ada](https://ada.tech/sou-aluno) and [Americanas](https://carreiras.americanas.com/).

### Main Menu

</p>

Customers are stored in memory using a list of objects of type `Client` inside the `InMemoryDatabase` class.

To create a JSP page that had the registered users, when requested by the ListClientsServerlet, the UserService builds the HTML code with the necessary tags for styling based on the list of clients present in the `InMemoryDatabase`.
